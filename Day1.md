## How Internet Actually Works?
    The Internet works through a hierarchy of connectivity. At the core, data centers and backbone providers host and route vast amounts of data. Tier 1 companies (like AT&T, CenturyLink, NTT, etc.) maintain global Internet backbones and connect with each other without paying transit fees (this is called peering).
    Internet Service Providers (ISPs), such as Tier 2 and Tier 3 providers, purchase bandwidth or connectivity from these backbone providers or larger ISPs.Finally, end users (individuals or businesses) connect to the Internet through these local ISPs.

## What are servers? 
    A system which serves to the client. like 
    file server: To get some file   
    database server: To save some data 
    Application server: To run some application 
    web server: To show some static data
